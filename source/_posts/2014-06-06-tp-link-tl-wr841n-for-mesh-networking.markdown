Last night, I bought four [TP-Link TL-WR841N](http://www.tp-link.us/products/details/?categoryid=238&model=TL-WR841N) wireless routers. They were really cheap (17USD each) on sale, and [OpenWrt](http://openwrt.org/) supports them [quite well](http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd).

I'm going to use them for playing around with wireless mesh networks. I've always been curious about mesh networks, but never really had the money for mesh hardware. Now with an OpenWrt-supported platform that is cheaper than dinner at a restaurant, I can satisfy my curiosity.

I will make sure to keep this blog updated with my exploits.
