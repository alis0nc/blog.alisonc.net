So I made a list of new years resolutions yesterday. Maybe I'll have a higher 
chance of actually keeping any of them if i go public with them on this blog.

1. **Pay off all my debt.** And keep it paid off.
1. **Moratorium on technology spending.** Only spend money replacing things 
   that catastrophically fail.
2. **Backups.** Make such a catastrophic failure survivable.
3. **Get rid of Animal Crossing: New Leaf.** Actually progressing with it (getting 
   rare items/good HHA scores/etc) is a massive time suck that I can't afford. The 
   game has capitalist undertones anyway.
4. **Get rid of one piece of technology per month.** I have too much technology 
   and need to get rid of it. I'll either sell or give away things, or failing 
   that, recycle it.
9. **Pay more attention to my appearance.** Hey, it might actually be fun!
5. **Get fit.** I don't necessarily mean lose weight. I mean get fit and have a 
   body i love and would feel comfortable showing off by putting a bikini on. 
   Gone are the days of sitting on the couch (or laying on the floor)
   and eating triscuits.
7. **Cook more.** I really enjoy cooking, I just need to practise more and get 
   better at it. A friend just gifted me tofu after our D&D group meeting (she 
   made dinner for the group and had half a block of tofu left), so this should 
   help.
6. **Become *totally* vegetarian.** No more cheat days for things like gelatine, 
   or sushi with fish in it.
10. **Volunteer more.** Helping out the autistic and queer communities around 
    Flint!
