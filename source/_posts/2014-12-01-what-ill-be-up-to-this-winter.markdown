Hello. I've been pretty lax in updating this blog, I guess that's because I 
have been busy with school and work. However, I have a couple interesting 
projects that should keep me busy this winter.

One of them is [vin](https://github.com/alis0nc/vin), a Python app (eventually
will be a webapp) to display Michigan's state mandated liquor prices in a nice 
searchable sortable format. Sure, the description of it says "let's get drunk 
on the cheap", and it will be sortable by alcohol per dollar, but really I don't 
get drunk on alcohol, I just get drunk on data.

The other is [kuthesis](https://github.com/alis0nc/kuthesis), a LaTeX class for 
the Kettering University thesis format. As I finish my academic career at Kettering, 
I'll have to write a thesis. Modern word processors like MS Word and (Libre,Open)Office
Writer just get in my way, so I'm a huge LaTeX fan. The kuthesis class is building 
upon [Arthur Shipkowski](http://www.fox-dreams.com/art/)'s work in the early 2000s 
and updating it for Kettering's current thesis format.

I've also softmodded my Wii last weekend (instead of shopping on Black Friday, I 
took a thing I have now and made it do awesome things). The 
[Complete Softmod Guide](https://sites.google.com/site/completesg/) and 
[WiiBrew](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Main_Page) wiki were super helpful resources, but 
I'm going to write a blog post later this week detailing what I did, so I can 
replicate it. A friend has already asked me to help them softmod their Wii.

As far as non-techie stuff, I will attend a [Mental Health First Aid](http://www.genhs.org/mhfa)
training organised by the Genesee Health System in a couple weeks. When one of 
my friends trusts me enough to share their mental health issues with me, I'd like 
to be able to help the best that I can.

I've also recently become aware of the 
[Autism Support and Resource Centre](http://www.geneseeautism.org/) (warning: Flash 
only site unless mobile device) and plan to start volunteering there soon.
