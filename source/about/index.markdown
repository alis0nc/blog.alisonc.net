I'm Alison. I am currently a senior computer science/computer engineering 
student at [Kettering University](http://kettering.edu/), and I plan on pursuing 
a Master in Social Work (MSW) degree upon graduation from Kettering. 

My technical interests include free software, embedded OS, LaTeX, game console 
modding, and video projection. My non-technical interests include mental health 
and disability (especially autism/developmental disabilities) support and activism, 
vegetarian/vegan cooking, live music, and creating and furthering anti-oppressive spaces.

I have a [résumé](https://github.com/alis0nc/resume) 
([pdf link](http://alisonc.net/~alisonc/resume.pdf)).

The best way to contact me is email: **alisonc at alisonc dot net**.
